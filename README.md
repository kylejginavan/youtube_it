## Description

youtube\_it is the most complete Ruby client for the YouTube GData API. It provides an easy way to access YouTube's video API. Compared to earlier YouTube interfaces, this new API and library offers much-improved flexibility around executing complex search queries to obtain well-targeted video search results. Also included is standard video management such as uploading, deleting, updating, liking, disliking, ratings and comments.

## Installation & Setup

  * Create a youtube account.
  * Create a developer key here http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/dashboard.
  * sudo gem install youtube\_it


Note: youtube\_it supports ClientLogin(YouTube account), OAuth, or AuthSub authentication methods.

## Example Rails 3 App

An example of how to use youtube\_it with Rails 3 can be found [here](http://github.com/chebyte/youtube_it_rails_app_example).

## Demo

You can see youtube\_it in action [here](http://youtube-it.heroku.com).

## Establishing a Client

Important: The Account Authentication API for OAuth 1.0, AuthSub and Client Login has been officially deprecated as of April 20, 2012. It will continue to work as per our [deprecation policy](https://developers.google.com/accounts/terms), but we encourage you to migrate to OAuth 2.0 authentication as soon as possible. If you are building a new application, you should use OAuth 2.0 authentication.

####Creating a Client
```ruby
require 'youtube_it'
client = YouTubeIt::Client.new
```

####Client with Developer Key

```ruby
client = YouTubeIt::Client.new(:dev_key => "developer_key")
```

####Client with YouTube Account and Developer Key

```ruby
client = YouTubeIt::Client.new(:username => "youtube_username", :password =>  "youtube_password", :dev_key => "developer_key")
```

####Client with AuthSub

```ruby
client = YouTubeIt::AuthSubClient.new(:token => "token" , :dev_key => "developer_key")
```

####Client with OAuth

```ruby
client = YouTubeIt::OAuthClient.new("consumer_key", "consumer_secret", "youtube_username", "developer_key")
client.authorize_from_access("access_token", "access_secret")
```

####Client with OAuth2

```ruby
client = YouTubeIt::OAuth2Client.new(client_access_token: "access_token", client_refresh_token: "refresh_token", client_id: "client_id", client_secret: "client_secret", dev_key: "dev_key", expires_at: "expiration time")
```

If your access token is still valid (be careful, access tokens may only be valid for about 1 hour), you can use the client directly. Refreshing the token is simple:

```ruby
client.refresh_access_token!
```

You can see more about OAuth2 in the [wiki]( https://github.com/kylejginavan/youtube_it/wiki/How-To:-Use-OAuth-2).

## Profiles

You can use multiple profiles in the same account:

```ruby
profiles = client.profiles(['username1','username2']) 
profiles['username1'].username, "username1"
```

## Video Queries

Note:  Each type of client enables searching capabilities.

###Basic Queries

```ruby
client.videos_by(:query => "penguin")
client.videos_by(:query => "penguin", :page => 2, :per_page => 15)
client.videos_by(:query => "penguin", :restriction => "DE")
client.videos_by(:tags => ['tiger', 'leopard'])
client.videos_by(:categories => [:news, :sports])
client.videos_by(:categories => [:news, :sports], :tags => ['soccer', 'football'])
client.videos_by(:user => 'liz')
client.videos_by(:favorites, :user => 'liz')
client.video_by("FQK1URcxmb4")
client.video_by("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsbmrCtiEUU")  
client.video_by_user("chebyte","FQK1URcxmb4")
```

###Standard Queries

```ruby
client.videos_by(:most_viewed)
client.videos_by(:most_linked, :page => 3)
client.videos_by(:top_rated, :time => :today)
```

###Advanced Queries (with boolean operators OR (either), AND (include), NOT (exclude))

```ruby
client.videos_by(:categories => { :either => [:news, :sports], :exclude => [:comedy] }, :tags => { :include => ['football'], :exclude => ['soccer'] })
```


###Custom Query Params

```ruby
client.videos_by(:query => "penguin", :safe_search => "strict")
client.videos_by(:query => "penguin", :duration => "long")
client.videos_by(:query => "penguin", :hd => "true")
client.videos_by(:query => "penguin", :region => "AR")
```

You can see more options [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/2.0/reference#yt_format).

####Fields Parameter(experimental features):
Return videos more than 1000 views:

```ruby
client.videos_by(:fields => {:view_count => "1000"})
```

####Filter by date

```ruby
client.videos_by(:fields => {:published  => ((Date.today)})
client.videos_by(:fields => {:recorded   => ((Date.today)})  
```

####Filter by date with range

```ruby
client.videos_by(:fields => {:published  => ((Date.today - 30)..(Date.today))})
client.videos_by(:fields => {:recorded   => ((Date.today - 30)..(Date.today))})  
```

Note: These queries do not find private videos! Use these methods instead:
```ruby
client.get_my_video("FQK1URcxmb4")
client.get_my_videos(:query => "penguin")
```

##Video Management

Note: YouTube account, OAuth, or AuthSub enables video management.

client.video_upload(File.open("test.mov"), :title => "test",:description => 'some description', :category => 'People',:keywords => %w[cool blah test])

## Access Control List

You can give permissions in your videos, for example denied comments, rate, etc...
More info [here](http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/2.0/reference.html#youtube_data_api_tag_yt:accessControl).

You have available the followings options:

* :rate, :comment, :commentVote, :videoRespond, :list, :embed, :syndicate

with just two values:

* allowed or denied

####Example (Upload Video with Denied Comments)

```ruby
client = YouTubeIt::Client.new(:username => "youtube_username", :password =>  "youtube_password", :dev_key => "developer_key")
client.video_upload(File.open("test.mov"), :title => "test",:description => 'some description', :category => 'People',:keywords => %w[cool blah test], :comment => "denied")
```

## User Activity

You can get user activity with the followings params:

```ruby
client.activity(user) #default current user
```

## Video Upload from Browser

When uploading a video from your browser you need make a form upload with the followings params:

```ruby
upload_token(params, nexturl)
```

####Example params

```ruby
:title => "title", :description => "description", :category => "People", :tags => ["test"]
```

nexturl is the url to redirect to after upload is complete

Controller

```ruby
def upload
  @upload_info = YouTubeIt::Client.new.upload_token(params, videos_url)
end
```

View (upload.html.erb)

```erb
<% form_tag @upload_info[:url], :multipart => true do %>
  <%= hidden_field_tag :token, @upload_info[:token] %>
  <%= label_tag :file %>
  <%= file_field_tag :file %>
  <%= submit_tag "Upload video" %>
<% end %>
```

## Widescreen Video

If the video has support for widescreen

```ruby
video.embed_html_with_width(1280)
```

Note: you can specify width or just use the default of 1280.

## Using HTML5

Now you can embed videos without Flash using HTML5. Useful for mobile devices that do not support Flash.

You can specify these options:

```ruby
video.embed_html5({:class => 'video-player', :id => 'my-video', :width => '425', :height => '350', :frameborder => '1', :url_params => {:option_one => "value", :option_two => "value"}})
```

or just use with default options:

```ruby
video.embed_html5 #default: width: 425, height: 350, frameborder: 0
```

## Logging

youtube\_it passes all logs through the logger variable on the class itself. In Rails context, assign the Rails logger to that variable to collect the messages (don't forget to set the level to debug)

```ruby
YouTubeIt.logger = RAILS_DEFAULT_LOGGER
RAILS_DEFAULT_LOGGER.level = Logger::DEBUG
```
